This is a proof of concept. It may or may not work.
See existing issues for more information on the progress.


## Credits

Most of the code is derived from [@koxudaxi/ruff-pycharm-plugin][3].
It is such a fortune that that plugin does almost the same thing
and is also written in Kotlin, and hence easily understandable.

The SVG and PNG logos are derived from [the README image][4]
of the [@microsoft/pyright][2] repository,
generated using Inkscape's autotrace feature.
