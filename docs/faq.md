# Frequently asked questions


## What exactly is this plugin doing?

Most of the logic is already defined by either the [@eclipse-lsp4j/lsp4j][1]
library or [the experimental language server protocol APIs][2].
This plugin simply glues these and the Pyright language server together.

The executable is not checked in any way.
You can use your own hand-hacked version if you feel like it.


## Why is this page so short?
